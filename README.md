Database Design and Development: ET Transport

This project was developed as part of my Professional Certificate in Data Science at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology. 

The objectives of this case study involve addressing the following key areas and providing solutions through data-driven analysis :

1. Reduce Fleet Downtime ( Fleet downtime means minimizing the time that vehicles are 
not in use or out of service) 
2. Increase Fleet Utilization (Fleet utilization simply refers to how effectively a company's 
vehicles are used in the perspective of space )
3. Improve On-Time Delivery
4. Reduce Operating Costs per Mile
5. Enhance Data Accuracy
6. Improve Customer Satisfaction Scores
